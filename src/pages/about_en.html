    <h1 class="sub-title">Hi, I’m Hamon-Rá Taveira Guimarãe.</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I’m a developer who likes to understand how things work all the way down, from web APIs and cloud infra to boot flows and CPU details.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p class="sub-title">What I do professionally</p>
    <br>
    <p>Most of my “real-world” work is backend/web engineering:</p>
    <ul class="grid-list-ul">
        <li>Building APIs, integrations, and message-driven systems</li>
        <li>Working with AWS (Lambda, SQS, ECS/EC2, S3, RDS)</li>
        <li>Caring a lot about observability (CloudWatch + Grafana), reliability, and clean architecture</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p class="sub-title">What I build for myself</p>
    <br>
    <p>My personal projects go low-level and long-term. The main one is Ex-Nihilo Core: a RV32 RISC-V emulator written in C.
        I built a real boot flow that can run a Linux kernel (OpenSBI + DTB + kernel image).
        It’s the kind of project that forces you to respect specs, debugging, and “truth over vibes”.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I also mess around with hardware (FPGA/microcontrollers/Raspberry Pi/ESP32) and I’m slowly moving toward a bigger goal:
        build my own RISC-V CPU and run Linux on it.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="sub-title">What this blog is about</p>
    <br>

    <p>This blog is basically my workshop log. You’ll find:</p>
    <ul class="grid-list-ul">
        <li>Deep dives on RISC-V, emulation, boot flows, toolchains, and debugging</li>
        <li>Backend notes: cloud architecture, queues, reliability, monitoring, practical lessons</li>
        <li>Game/engine R&D: rendering, performance, architecture decisions</li>
        <li>“What I learned the hard way” posts (the best kind)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p class="sub-title">My style</p>
    <br>
    <p>I try to write like a human:</p>
    <ul class="grid-list-ul">
        <li>Clear steps</li>
        <li>Less hype, more “here’s what actually worked”</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>If something here helps you build your own thing, perfect. That’s the point. And I am always available. You can find me on linkedin or github.</p>
